# Current

This project is currently on hold. The dart SDK ffi library cannot pass structs by value so is not ready to work with this library.

# dart-libgphoto2

dart-libgphoto2 is a library that adds bindings for the libgphoto2 library. This library is originally developed with the intent to run a large 3d scanning rig. The design files and software are all designed with open source in mind. If you have any questions or would like to develope your own 3d scanning rig please feel free to contact me.

This is an ongoing project and contributions are welcome.

This library will hopefully not just include the bindings to the c library but also include helper functions to make interfacing and using the library much easier.

## Getting Started

The final binary must include the libgphoto2 library next to it.
